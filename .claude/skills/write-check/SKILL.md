name: write-check
description: Open the local Write Check app (markdown grammar, spelling and AI-style checker for German and English) and collaborate on a text. Use when the user wants to check, improve, or draft a text, wants writing feedback (logic, clarity, style), or types /write-check. Arguments are optional and may be the text itself or instructions on what to write.

# Write Check

Local Next.js app at `/home/outtaspacetime/Code/write-check`, served on **http://localhost:3456**. It checks markdown text for grammar/spelling (LanguageTool, German + English), AI-writing patterns (rule catalog + document statistics), and shows Claude review notes. The goal is not only fixing texts but helping Felix improve as a writer — feedback must always explain *why* something is a problem.

## Start the services

Run every command of this skill in the app directory.

1. Dev server: `curl -sf http://localhost:3456/api/review >/dev/null 2>&1` — if this fails, run `npm install` if `node_modules` is missing, then `npm run dev` in the app directory as a background task, and wait until the URL responds:

   ```
   timeout 60 bash -c 'until curl -sf http://localhost:3456/api/review >/dev/null; do sleep 1; done'
   ```
2. LanguageTool: `docker start languagetool 2>/dev/null || docker run -d --name languagetool -p 8010:8010 erikvl87/languagetool`

## One directory per check

Every new check gets its own directory inside the app: `data/checks/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<slug>/`, holding `document.md` and `review.json`. The date is today, the slug a short kebab-case name for the topic (`2026-09-10-hyprland-post`, `2026-09-10-knowledge-card-draft`). Never write into `data/document.md` — that is the old shared scratch document.

- Pick the path once at the start of a check and keep using it for the rest of the conversation: further edits, rewrites and review notes go into that same directory.
- A new `/write-check` invocation, or a text that is plainly a different piece of writing, gets a new directory. Earlier checks stay readable where they are.
- Before picking a slug, `ls data/checks/` — if the user is continuing a text you already worked on, reuse its directory instead of making a near-duplicate.

Open the app on that check as a web app — its own window without title bar or browser UI. Never use `xdg-open`, which opens a browser tab instead:

```
omarchy-launch-webapp 'http://localhost:3456/?doc=checks/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<slug>'
```

Tell the user the relative path you chose, so they can reopen it later.

## The document

- The single source of truth is `document.md` inside the check directory. The browser editor and this file sync automatically every ~2.5 s (last writer wins; the app also autosaves edits made in the browser back to this file).
- `/write-check <text>` → Write the given text to `document.md`, then open the app on that check.
- `/write-check <instructions>` → Draft the text yourself, write it to `document.md`, then open the app. When drafting: be concrete and specific, avoid the AI-boilerplate the app flags (delve, tapestry, "plays a pivotal role", "in today's digital age", formulaic transitions, em-dash chains, uniform sentence rhythm — and the German equivalents: "in der heutigen digitalen Welt", "spielt eine entscheidende Rolle", "zudem"-chains, Fazit-Formeln). Write like a person with an opinion, not a brochure.
- `/write-check` with no arguments → ask which text this is about, or start an empty check directory and open the app on it.
- When the user asks you to correct or rewrite something: edit the check's `document.md` directly with the Edit tool; the browser picks it up automatically and underlines the words you changed in teal, so the user sees what you did. The underlines stay until the user edits those words or clears them.

## Giving feedback (review notes)

Write your feedback to `review.json` next to the document in the same check directory. Within ~2.5 s the UI shows each note, labeled "Claude", under the cell (the editor box) that holds its quote. Format:

```json
{
  "notes": [
    {
      "quote": "exact substring copied from document.md",
      "scope": "optional: \"cell\" or \"missing\"",
      "title": "Contradicts earlier claim",
      "message": "What is wrong, in one or two sentences.",
      "explanation": "Why this is a problem — teach the underlying writing principle.",
      "suggestion": "Optional concrete rewrite.",
      "severity": "warning"
    }
  ]
}
```

Rules:
- `quote` must be copied verbatim from the current `document.md` so the note anchors to the right spot (it becomes clickable and underlined in the editor). Notes anchor to the FIRST occurrence of the quote — if the phrase appears more than once, extend the quote until it is unique.
- Pick where a note lives:
  - no `scope`: the note is about the quoted words, which get underlined.
  - `"scope": "cell"`: the note is about the whole paragraph that holds the quote ("this paragraph has no point"). Quote a few words from it; nothing is underlined.
  - `"scope": "missing"`: something is missing right after the quote (a step, a number, a transition). The note appears as a dashed "Something is missing here" slot after that paragraph.
  - no `quote`: the note appears in the "Whole text" box above the first cell. Use it only for a point no quote can carry: the order of the sections, a template or audience the whole text must fit, a decision from the chat that has no place in the text. A missing section or counter-argument usually has a spot (after the claim it should answer, between the sections it belongs between) and goes there as a `"missing"` note.
- Never put a point in the "Whole text" box that is anchored, or could be. No overview of the anchored notes ("Where to shorten: merge the paragraphs under 3, shrink the explanation under 4, end with a question"), and no "this happens throughout" note for a problem you can point to.
- When one problem shows up in several places, put a note at each place. The first carries the full `message` and `explanation`. Each further one keeps the same `title`, says in `message` that it is the same problem as the note on "<first note's quote>", gives a `suggestion` for that line only, and has no `explanation`.
- `severity`: `"error"` (broken logic, factual contradiction), `"warning"` (unclear, weak argument), `"info"` (style polish).
- Review for: **logic soundness** (does each claim follow from its support? non-sequiturs? contradictions? unsupported leaps?), **clarity** (is the point of each section stated and reachable? undefined jargon? buried lede?), and anything discussed in the current chat — feedback the user gave you or conclusions from your discussion belong in the notes too, so the app shows one consolidated list. Anchor them like any other note.
- Every note must teach: always fill `explanation` with the principle, not just the fix. The only exception is a further note on a repeated problem, described in the rule above.
- After writing `review.json`, run this in the app directory. It prints every quote that is not found exactly once in the document, because a quote that isn't found lands its note in the "Whole text" box. A quote whose `suggestion` is in the text counts as found, because the user applied it. Fix each one it prints:

  ```
  node -e 'const fs=require("fs"),d=process.argv[1],t=fs.readFileSync(d+"/document.md","utf8");for(const {quote:q,suggestion:s} of JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(d+"/review.json","utf8")).notes){const n=q?t.split(q).length-1:1;if(n>1)console.log("not unique:",q);if(n===0&&!(s&&t.includes(s)))console.log("not found:",q)}' data/checks/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<slug>
  ```
- Replace the whole file each time; write `{"notes": []}` to clear. Notes whose quote no longer matches the text move to the "Whole text" box with a "quoted words are no longer in the text" line, unless the note's `suggestion` was applied: then the note stays on the suggested words with a button to revert to the quote.
- The user ticks notes off as done. `done.json` in the check directory lists them: Claude notes as `claude|<title>|<quote>`, app findings as `<ruleId>|<flagged words>`. Read it before writing a new review and don't repeat a note the user already closed unless the problem came back in a new form; keep the same `title` and `quote` for a note you carry over, or its tick is lost.
- `cells.json` is the app's own record of how the user split and merged cells. Don't edit it.

## Reading the app's own findings

To see what the automated checks currently flag (grammar, spelling, AI patterns, metrics), run in the app directory:

```
node scripts/print-check.mjs --doc=checks/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<slug>
```

Append `de-DE` or `en-US` to force the language. Use this before discussing the text so your feedback and the app's findings don't contradict each other, and to answer questions like "why is this flagged?".

## Technical words the spell checker doesn't know

Every time you write or change `document.md`, run `print-check` afterwards and go through the spelling findings. LanguageTool flags tool, library and project names it has no dictionary entry for (`esbuild`, `oxc`, `rolldown`, `Angular`, `Vite`). These are noise, not mistakes.

- Add each flagged word that is clearly a technical name, spelled the way its project spells it, to `data/words.json` (`{"words": [...]}`). Copy the flagged span exactly as it appears in the text. Matching ignores case.
- The file is shared by every check. Keep the words already in it, and create it if it doesn't exist.
- Never add a real misspelling, an ordinary word, or a misspelled technical name (`esbiuld`). When you're unsure whether a word is a technical name, leave the finding for the user.
- The app reloads the list every ~2.5 s and runs the check again, so the findings disappear without a page reload. Run `print-check` once more to confirm only real spelling findings remain.
